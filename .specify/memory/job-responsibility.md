    Q --> P
```

#### Narrative Description
Lee navigates through the network file structure to locate the specific job folder. Due to inconsistent customer naming conventions, he must search through various similar names to find the correct job. Once located, he accesses the job folder containing 9 standard department folders and the KOM file. He opens the KOM file in Excel to extract equipment specifications and prints it for easy reference due to slow network speeds. The printed copy serves as his working reference throughout the drafting process.

#### Quality Checkpoints
- Verify correct customer folder found
- Confirm job number folder exists and is accessible
- Validate KOM file contains required equipment specifications
- Ensure printed copy is legible and complete

#### Error Handling
- If customer name not found, try variations and similar spellings
- If job folder doesn't exist, wait for creation by lead (Pete) or other team member
- If KOM file is corrupted or incomplete, contact sales team for updated version
- If network is too slow, work with printed copy and update as needed

#### Software Integration Details
- **Primary Software**: Windows File Explorer
- **Secondary Software**: Microsoft Excel
- **File Management**: Network drive mapping (varies per user)

Lee opens the gas train assembly and sets up the pilot detail view by removing unnecessary components. He then accesses the gas train drawing sheet and uses a template drawing to copy the BOM and drawing views to the customer's job drawing. He repairs any broken annotations and completes the data form.

#### Quality Checkpoints
- Verify pilot detail view is correct
- Confirm BOM is properly copied
- Ensure all balloons and dimensions are intact

#### Error Handling
- If view issues, check component visibility
- If BOM problems, verify template structure
- If annotation issues, repair manually

#### Software Integration Details
- **Primary Software**: Autodesk Inventor 2022
- **File Types**: .iam (assemblies), .idw (drawings)
- **Template System**: Gas train template drawings
- **View Management**: Pilot detail view representation
