PDF: 21-2702_EQUIPMENT_LAYOUT.pdf
PDF: 42-3249_HTR_ASSY.pdf
Steps
1. Heater Setup Drawing Scale/Views & Part Number Assignment
- Open .idw for current project
- Adjust the view scale to ensure the content will fit and be readable
- Open the Heater Assembly
- Click "Enter Parameters" button in the iLogic Forms Panel
- Goto "Drawing Numbers" tab on Form
- testy test
- Edit the Heater Final Assy part number
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2. Assembly Mod Piping View Representation Update
- Open Heater Assy (ffa.iam)
- Activate Mod Piping View for editing
- Exclude Gas Train Assembly from Mod Piping View Representation

 
 
 
3. Mod Piping Assembly Hose Assy Documentation
- Edit Mod Pipe Assembly
- Measure Hose Length, round to closest inch, then add 3" to length
- 27.096 = 27 + 3 = 30"
- Open Dynamics D365 and Go to "Released Products"
- Search for "894-01-*" (Item Number search)
- Filter for Hose Size and length
- Select correct Hose Assembly
- Open Assembly Form again and Select "Hose Part Number / Length" tab
- Enter the measured Hose length and update length and Hose Part Number
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4. Gas Train Assembly/Drawing Initial Setup
- Open Gas Train Assembly
- Edit "Pilot Detail" View Representation, activate and edit it
- Remove all components except the Pilot Detail Components
- Navigate to Gas Train Drawing Sheet
- Open Gas Train Template Drawing within the Customer FABS folder
- Copy and Paste BOM and Drawing views from the template drawing to the Customer Job 
Drawing
- Repair any broken Balloons/Dimensions
- Click "Open Data" form and complete form
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5. Verify Inventor Heater Assembly (FFA.iam) Form Values match Engineering Documents
- open reference files or use printouts
- Update Ballast Packing Rings
- Verify All Assembly form Values
- Verify Heater Model
- Verify Location (US, CANADA)
- Verify Heater Diameter
- Verify Heater Height 152" / 12 = 12.67ft = 12'
- Verify Stack Diameter = 18"
- Verify Application = standard (because it is not a food grade application, it is concrete)
- Verify Material = 304 Stainless because the Spray nozzle is spec'd out as CS (Common 
Steel)
- Verify Burner Model (Gas Train) = Maxon #487M
- Verify Gas Train Position = Left
- Verify Heater Mounting = Pumped
- Verify Gauge Cocks = NSF (Because NSF has become Standard)
- Verify Temp Switch Material = Stainless (Per the decision to not use brass any more)
- Verify Packaging (Mod Piping Typ) = Modular Piping (because it is now the standard)
- Verify Mod Piping (Transducer Material) = SS316 Ends because we are no longer using 
Brass hose ends
- Verify Modulating Valve (Yes/No) = No (Because it is not spec'd out)
- Verify Media Frame Height (54 Standard) 
- Verify Gas = NG

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
6. Spray Nozzle and Nipple Size Verify/Update
- Check Nipple and Spray Nozzle size on Drawing
- Check Water Inlet Size = 2"
- Update Spray Nozzle
- Select Spray nozzle in the Assy model
- Open Assy Form and click "Replace Spray Nozzle"
- Select Local working folder
- Select Libraries
- Select Fittings
- Select Spray Nozzles
- Select Spray Nozzle Size
- WTF WTH
- Select Engineering Spec'd Nozzle and click "Open"
- Update Spray Nozzle Nipple
- Select Nipple in Assy Model
- Click "Change Spray Nozzle Nipple Size"
- Choose required nipple size and click Okay
- Pull down on the spray nozzle to get the Model to update the constraints
- Verify Spray Nozzle dimensions between Engineering Values and Model Values

5. Drafting - Drawing Package Creation/Update from Modeling Changes
Steps
1. DRAFTING: BOM Updates to Heater Final/Modular Piping Sheets
 
Open BOM in edit mode and expand Heater Mod Piping Assy
 
Hide Mod Pipe Assy
 
Hide All other components that are not part of the Mod Pipe Assy and Click OK
 
Move the top view down and adjust the BOM column width and hide any blank rows 
in the BOM
- Open the Heater Final Sheet and open the BOM for edits
 
Hide the Mod Pipe Assy Parts that are now displaying after changing the Mod Pipe 
Drawing Sheet BOM
- Export BOM to Excel file for verifying that BOM in inventor matches the intended BOM 
from Engineering.
- Save the Drawing
 
2. DRAFTING: Heater Assembly Drawing Creation (.idw)
